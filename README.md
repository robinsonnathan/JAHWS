# JAHWS
JAHWS is a learning project.  Just Another Hello World Site is a project of very small, frequent, changes. 

For years I've tried to become a developer.  Every day I wake up, get overwhelmed, and quit before I start. I just can't get over imposter syndrome. Therefore, this project is how I work to change my habits.  I will make at least a single change once a day.  Every day.  Until I die.  Will this be the world's coolest Hello World site in a few years?  Maybe, just maybe.

(Note to Recruiters: Look at my commit history.  Did I fulfill on my promise?  IF so, remember it's not about the quality of code.  But the consistency of the developer ;)
